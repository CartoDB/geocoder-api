### Demographic Functions

<div class="is-caption is-caption--mobile header-warning is-semibold u-vspace--16">
  <p>We will no longer support these demographic functions from the 1st of January 2021. If you want to collect demographic reports around a point location, we recommend using Data Observatory from our Phython library <a href="https://carto.com/developers/cartoframes/">CARTOframes</a> instead.</p>
</div>

The Demographic Snapshot enables you to collect demographic reports around a point location. For example, you can take the coordinates of a coffee shop and find the average population characteristics, such as total population, educational attainment, housing and income information around that location. You can use raw street addresses by combining the Demographic Snapshot with CARTO's geocoding features. If you need help creating coordinates from addresses, see the [Geocoding Functions]({{site.dataservicesapi_docs}}/reference/#geocoding-functions) documentation.

_**Note:** The Demographic Snapshot functions are only available for the United States._

#### OBS_GetDemographicSnapshot( point geometry )

Fields returned include information about income, education, transportation, race, and more. Not all fields will have information for every coordinate queried.

##### Arguments

Name | Description | Example Values
--- | --- | ---
point geometry | A point geometry. You can use the helper function, `CDB_LatLng` to quickly generate one from latitude and longitude | `CDB_LatLng(40.760410,-73.964242)`

##### Returns

The Demographic Snapshot contains a broad subset of demographic measures in the Data Observatory. Over 80 measurements are returned by a single API request. For each demographic measure, the API returns the following values.

Value | Name | Tablename | Aggregate | Type | Description
----- | ---- | --------- | --------- | ---- |------------
The value of the measure at the point you requested | The name of the measure | The table it was drawn from | Indicated if the measure is a count or median. | postgresql | A description of the measure

For example the "Female Population" measure returns

```json
obs_getdemographicsnapshot: {
   "value": 32.5395066379175,
   "name": "Female Population",
   "tablename": "obs_1a098da56badf5f32e336002b0a81708c40d29cd",
   "aggregate": "sum",
   "type": "Numeric",
   "description": "The number of people within each geography who are female."
}
```
