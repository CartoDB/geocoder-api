## Segmentation Functions

<div class="is-caption is-caption--mobile header-warning is-semibold u-vspace--16">
  <p>We will no longer support these segmentations functions from the 1st of January 2021. For a similar functionality, we recommend using Data Observatory from our Python library <a href="https://carto.com/developers/cartoframes/">CARTOframes</a> instead.</p>
